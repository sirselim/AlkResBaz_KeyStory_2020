# Key Story - Harnessing the disruptive nature of portable sequencing for community empowerment

The current 'climate' is full of buzz words, such as: AI (artificial intelligence); deep learning; cloud computing, and the 'Internet of Things'. As consumers, and even research specialists, this can all be overwhelming. At ESR we are endeavouring to provide our staff, clients, and hopefully the wider community, with some insight into the technologies behind this jargon. In this talk I will discuss our experiences with the Nvidia Jetson family of small embedded computing platforms. What started as an idea to address a very personal need has developed into an international, collaborative, cross-programme study to develop and deploy an innovative, disruptive, portable and affordable sequencing technology into the hands of the community to empower their health and well-being. Additionally, the affordable, easy to source components provide exciting opportunities for such endeavours as community outreach and education.
